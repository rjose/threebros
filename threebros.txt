Overview
--------
I need to learn how to make something move around in a game. The
first step is to get it to move around. The second step is to create
some obstacles. The third step is to pan as we move.

Prototypes
----------

        * [] Proto1: Move a character around [X][][]
        * [] Proto2: Move around obstacles [][][][]
        * [] Proto3: Pan during a move [][][]
        * [] Proto4: Animating during moving [][][]


Proto1: Move a character around
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alright, we should be able to use the doodle jump mechanics, I
think. I should be able to repurpose most of the doodle jump stuff.
Just take out gravity. Still use the same assets. Let's create a new
workspace in '~/prototypes/3bros' and then have each project by a new
prototype. Done. I also got the game running. Now, let's remove
gravity and see if I can read a movement vector. Hmmm...this doesn't
seem very obvious. I wonder if I should start with something super
basic. Let's do the same thing as the demo examples they give.

We'll start with the demo example just before the jumper. I'll get
it set up with the new SDK and then rename it. Once that's done,
I'll strip it down and then check it in. Let's see if we can git an
eclipse git plugin to work. Done.

OK, I've co-opted the cannon test to use as the move test. I want to
see if I can get a vector first from a drag. After that, I'll move
something around.
